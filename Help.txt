"==WELCOME TO TURVY=="

"=Story="

"Tina 'Topsy' Turvy has an unusual ability: she can twist"
"her own gravity at will. Unfortunately, this has made her"
"the target of a mad scientist looking to exploit her"
"powers for his own gain, and has captured her for his"
"experiments! But Topsy isn't about to stand for that and"
"is all too happy to use her skills to flee this"
"criminal's lab and regain her freedom."

"=How To Play="

"Get Topsy to the exit through clever use of her"
"gravity-twisting powers."

"*Use your keyboard to move Topsy."
"*WASD controls her on-foot movement along a surface."
"*The arrow keys control the direction of Topsy's gravity."
"*You have no air control! You cannot change gravity or"
" move while falling."
"*If you fall two far (about two blocks), the landing will"
" knock Topsy senseless and you'll have to restart the"
" level."
"*If you come into contact with one of the robots seeking"
" Topsy's capture, they will shock you. Again, you will"
" be forced to restart."
"*You have four chances to finish the game. Run out and"
" it's back to the title screen."
