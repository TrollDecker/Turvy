# Turvy
An old college project (for the module "Developing Computer Games") in which I developed - against my better judgement, seriously - a puzzle-platformer inspired by Terry Cavanagh's *VVVVVV*. Players assume the roll of Tina "Topsy" Turvy, who must use her unusual gravity-twisting powers to escape an evil scientist's lab.

## How to Run
Honestly, there's no guarantee that it'll run at all, as it was written in Visual Basic 6 (which, in 2013, I found remarkably odd), though `@stitch@gnusocial.me` did succeed in compiling it for Linux to a point (it still crashed, but it could be played for a little bit). The primary purpose of this repistory, however, is largely for posterity.
